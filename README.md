# expense_tracker

## About

This expense tracker project is what I will be using to show and reinforce lessons learned while I attended the Back End, SQL, and DevOps with Python bootcamp with Nucamp.co.
I will be taking the expense tracker project I completed in the first course of the bootcamp and adding to it from the other courses. 

## To-Do
□ Clean up initial project files.

□ Implement databases to store expenses, expense reports, and expense categories.

□ Deploy to Azure and utilize AKS.
